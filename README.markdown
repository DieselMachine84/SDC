SDC - The Stupid D Compiler
===========================

This is the home of a [D2](http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0) compiler.

SDC is at the moment, particularly stupid; it is a work in progress. Feel free to poke around, but don't expect it to compile your code.

Also, I don't know what I'm doing in terms of compiler writing. If you find some horrible design decision, that's most likely why.

The code is released under the GPL (see the LICENCE file for more details), except for libdjson, which is not my code, and included here just for ease of compilation.
